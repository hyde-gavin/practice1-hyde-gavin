#### Due: 2/9/2022 before 11:59pm. Submit in Canvas (file upload).

1. Finish the in-class practice in Slides 3-12 in "Lecture 2-2-Practice for git", link: https://yumouqiu.github.io/DS202-Spring2022/Practice/practice01.html  
    a. Download the RMarkdown file with these homework instructions to use as a template for your work. Make sure to replace "Your Name" with your name.  
    b. In the RMarkdown file, write down table of team members, and their github repository links;   
the number of successful pull requests you made, and the github repository to which you requested a change;  
the number of pull requests you accepted, and the github repository from which you accepted.

    c. Write down a list with at least 3 tips of how to make working with git/github easier  
      1. Always push before you pull
      2. Make sure you have the file structure set up properly with Github
      3. Watch YouTube on anything you don't understand
      
2. Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada (fixed data) and Australia by RMarkdown based on the data set "gapminder-5060", like what we did in the class.  
Please use Github to collaborate on this problem. For example, one member can create the plot of US in his/her repository. The other member will fork this repository, add the result for the second country, and make a pull request for merging into the main repository. Each member should at least analyze one country and make at least one pull request. **Please submit the RMarkdown file, the output file, and the screen shot of the successful pull request and the merge.**

life5060 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ds202-at-isu/materials/master/01_collaborative-environment/data/gapminder-5060.csv")


canada_fixed <- canada %>% mutate(
  lifeExp = replace(lifeExp, year==1957, 69.96)  
)


canada_fixed %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap, colour=country)) + geom_line() +
  geom_line(data = life5060 %>% 
              filter(country %in% c("United States")))


3. Write a paragraph (~200 words) describing an example of what you consider data science. Write your paragraph in R Markdown. Include at least 
    a. one link to a chart or an image and 
    b. at least one itemized or enumerated list.
    
    I think one of the most relevant examples of data science would be the statistics around the COVID-19 virus. 
    Especially at the beginning of the pandemic, it was important to: 
    1. Gather data around the number of cases
    2. Interpert data relating to transmission and masks
    3. Find the relationship between vaccination and severity of symptoms
    4. Use this data to make public health decisions
    
    There were many line charts shown on the news, to let people know if the number of cases were going up or down, so
    they could determine how cautious they should be. Gathering and organizing this data was very important because
    then it could be used to predict the number and severity of cases, so that proper precautions and measures could
    be taken to handle the upcoming surge. This gave officials the chance to manage resources more effectively.

url <- "https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.statcdn.com%2FInfographic%2Fimages%2Fnormal%2F21346.jpeg"
print(paste("<center><src=\"", url, "\"></center>", collapse=""))


Note: your submission is supposed to be fully reproducible, i.e. the TA and I will 'knit' your submission in RStudio. Including the link to the image is the tricky part here. Make sure that you don't use any file structure that depends on your computing environment.


For the submission: submit your solution in an **R Markdown file** and (just for insurance) submit the corresponding html (or Word) file with it.
